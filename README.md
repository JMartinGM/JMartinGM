    👋 Hi! I’m Martín García-Montes (he/him), a novel neuroscientist from Madrid, Spain 
    🎓 BSc in Psychology, MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuropsychology at King Juan Carlos University
    📌 2st year PhD student on Psychology @ Department of Psychology , Faculty of Health Sciences (URJC)
    👀 I’m interested in Programming with Matlab, Cognitive Neuroscience and all psychology processes (learning, attention, emotion...)
    🧠 I’m currently learning how different neural representations modify episodic memory recollections
    💡 I want to learn more about how to program in Matlab for electroencephalogram data analysis and creation of experiments from paradigms
    💭 In the future I would like to learn how to use machine learning to decode cognitive processes (neural network)
    🔬 You can take a look at my research on ORCID, ResearchGate and Google Scholar
